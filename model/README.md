Welcome to the IMSIDE models.
IMSIDE: Idealised Model of Salt Intrusion in Deltas and Estuaries

There are three folders here:
Choose the folder sc ti if you want to do time-independent simulations in a single channel estuary.
Choose the folder sc td if you want to do time-dependent simulations in a single channel estuary.
Choose the folder netw  if you want to do time-independent or time-dependent simulations in a estuarine channel network.
In these folders, a README file is present which explains how to run the model.

The models use idealised equations of water motion and salinity to calculate the salt intrusion in deltas and estuaries.
Their applicability is e.g. for identification of salt intrusion mechanisms, and fast calculation of system response to changes.
The advantages of these models compared to 3D numerical models is mostly in terms of understandability, runtime and code clarity.
Everything is written in the programming language Python.


These models are developed as part of the PhD work of Bouke Biemond, 2020-2024 at Utrecht University.
